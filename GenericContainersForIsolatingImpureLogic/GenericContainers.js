 1. Create a container that constructs with impure function & implement the generic containers
    used for functional programming contain I/O to protects the pure code.

 2. Perform Lazy execution v/s lazy evaluation & show how containers can perform lazy execution & lazy promises using the container.

 3. Containerize the local storage API & connect containers to compositions & connect composition to our JSX & display JSON slides inside the app.

 4. Create a generic container that is useful to encapsulate the impure logic from pure code &
    perform lazy execution & connect composition to our JSX to build an app.
