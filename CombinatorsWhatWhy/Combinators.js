 /*
 1. Run some script to show the use of combinators & pass them through parameters. 

 2. Implement function getCartItemNames in a single function & console log various part of function & Explore the combinatory 
    that helps to debug point free program using tap to inspect any part of the composition.

 3. a).Create a function that behaves constantly using “const” combinator K-Combinator & join combinatory using S-Combinator & D-Combinator. 
      Design some logic compositor depending on join & use combinators to write & refactor the code.
    b).Take a two function f & g partially apply the control flow combinators “either/or” combinatory, “if-else” combinatory, 
      “when” combinatory & “conditions” combinators
 4. Create combinators with the good & the map, use tap for debugging the compositions & merge the logic with 
    combinators & run the control-flow conditional combinator.
