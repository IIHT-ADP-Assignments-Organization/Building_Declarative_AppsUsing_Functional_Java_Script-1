/*
 1. Write a single utility function that will compose N functions together use reduce to compose functions 
    together & pass compositions of functions into other composition pipelines.

 2. Write a program for type Compatibility input type & output types of functions & formalizing types using language 
    hilney-milner haystack function & make sense of the type annotation.

 3. Perform some mathematical laws by loading functional programming to computational mathematics show how can we represent 
    some of these laws with code & refactor using law of composition.

 4. Show how to compose functions together & write a utility to do function composition use reduce to compose functions together, 
   formalizing types using language hilney-milner haystack function & run some mathematical laws in functional programming.
